see stui.nim, textbox.nim

**Controll** is a ui element.  

app.activeControll: set this if focus changes  

`value`: is a string representation of the ..., for using in SQL etc...  
`value2`: is [T] representation of the value - if applicable  

other value/name functions as needed - see selectbox


disabled: used in mouse/key handlers

visible: used in draw()

drawit(): maybe methods would be better, but methods cannot be FWD declared (? nim 0.18)

activeStyle: from the controlls styles the currently active one - for draw

**Layout:**  

    layout automatcally calculated, see stui.nim recalc procs  
    you may override it with adding recalc proc to the Controll  
      
    recalc can use fixed width/height, or percent based width/height, depending on constructor (fixed uses int 100, relative uses string params "100")


**Event flow, automatic KM events: (Keyboard & Mouse)**  

    see mainloop.inc.nim  
  
    than stui.nim mouseEventHandler:  
        eventTarget.onClick(eventTarget, event)  
        eventTarget.onDoubleClick(eventTarget, event)  
        eventTarget.onScroll(eventTarget, event)  
        app.dragSource.onDrag(eventTarget, event)  
        eventTarget.onDrop(eventTarget, event)  

    key events:  
        if KeyPgUp, KeyPgDown trigger controlls proc first then apps  
        else: trigger apps cb first, then controlls  
  

**Window**
